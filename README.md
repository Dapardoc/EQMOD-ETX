# EQMOD-ETX
## Introduction
This project describes an arduino interface used between the ASCOM-EQMOD software and the 'HBX' interface to the Az and Alt motors controller. The device investigated was the ETX60AT. It provides a protocol translater to enable the features of EQMOD to be applied to the ETX scopes using the low-level HBX motor control commands.

## Notices
Information in this document was derived from multiple sources on the Weasner site. It is a summary of those documents and retains the original warnings/copyrights where they existed.
The main information comes from -:
1. http://www.weasner.com/etx/menu.html.  
2. US patent #6,304,376 is held by Meade.  
3. Some information is derived from observations of the interactions between the Autostar controller and the DH series motors. The information in this document was not derived via disassembly of the Autostar or motor processor firmware.  

Care must be taken to not violate the claims of the aforementioned patent in any application of this information.  

This work would not be possible without the contributions of Dick Seymour, Gene Chimahusky and others and is summarised, to the best of my ability, in the Documents section.
