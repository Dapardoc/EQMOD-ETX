# EQMOD-ETX
## Introduction
This project describes an arduino interface used between the ASCOM-EQMOD software and the 'HBX' interface to the Az and Alt motors controller. The device investigated was the ETX60AT. It provides a protocol translater to enable the features of EQMOD to be applied to the ETX scopes using the low-level HBX motor control commands.
