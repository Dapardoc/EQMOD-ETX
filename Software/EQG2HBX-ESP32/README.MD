THIS CODE IS NOT FULLY TESTED.  
IT STILL CONTAINS ERRORS AND IS UNDER ACTIVE DEBUG.
ONLY USE IT IF YOU WANT TO HELP.  

I use "Visual Studio - Community Edition" (https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/)  
 with "Visual Micro Explorer" (https://www.visualmicro.com/page/Arduino-Visual-Studio-Downloads.aspx)  

The vcxproj files will ease compilation, syntax highlighting, intellisense, auto-completion and library management.
